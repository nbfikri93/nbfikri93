- 👋 Hi, I’m Nabil Fikri. This is the space where I refresh my knowledge and upskill myself
- 👀 I’m particularly interested in C/C++ algorithm projects and embedded system development. I'm starting to get expose to Python automation too
- 🌱 Even though I have been working for 5 years, I believe I have a lot to improve in my coding skills
- 💞️ Maybe in the future, I’m looking to collaborate on your embedded system and algorithm development
- 📫 Reach me at nb.fikri@gmail.com or my Linkedin if you wish to get in touch with me
